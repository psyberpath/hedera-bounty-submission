# Verifiable Data Analytics Pipeline with Hedera (HCS)

**Bounty:** https://quest.hederahacks.com/quests/76
**Video Demo:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1um0rh5umeoh5RanZbCpBOZS5sI40o9xp?usp=drive_link

## üöÄ The Problem

Traditional analytics on SQL databases are vulnerable. Data can be tampered with by administrators or attackers, and compliance reports cannot be fully trusted. There is no way to *prove* that data hasn't been altered *after* it was written, making true data integrity impossible.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

This project is a **NestJS "bridge" service** that integrates with legacy SQL systems to create an **immutable, verifiable audit trail** on the **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**.

Every time a new piece of data is written to the local SQL database, this service:
1.  Generates a unique SHA-256 fingerprint (hash) of the data payload and its timestamp.
2.  Submits this hash to a private HCS topic, creating an immutable, timestamped "proof of existence."
3.  Saves the data *and* the resulting `hederaTransactionId` (the proof) to the local SQL database.

A `/verify` endpoint allows anyone (like an auditor) to check a log's integrity at any time. It re-calculates the local hash and compares it to the hash stored on the Hedera ledger, which is retrieved via a Hedera Mirror Node.

* If the hashes match, `isVerified: true` ‚úÖ
* If the local data has been tampered with, `isVerified: false` ‚ùå

## üèÜ How it Meets Bounty Requirements

This solution directly addresses all three quest requirements:

* **Req 1 (DLT Components):** Uses the **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** as a high-throughput, low-cost "trust layer" for logging. This is a perfect real-world use case for HCS.
* **Req 2 (Legacy Integration):** Directly integrates with a **`sqlite` (SQL) database** (representing a legacy system) and ingests data via a standard **REST API** (the NestJS app).
* **Req 3 (Real-World Application):** Demonstrates **automated compliance reporting** and **verifiable data analytics**. An auditor can now use the `/verify` endpoint to *programmatically prove* data integrity, redefining data-driven decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [your_github_repo_link]
    cd hedera-bounty
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root and add your Hedera Testnet credentials:
    ```.env
    MY_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.xxxxxx
    MY_PRIVATE_KEY=302e02010030...
    TOPIC_ID=0.0.xxxxxx
    ```
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üì° API Endpoints

### 1. Create a Verifiable Log

Submits a new log to the database and notarizes its hash on HCS.

**POST** `http://localhost:3000/logs`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user-9876",
  "eventType": "KYC_COMPLETED",
  "data": {
    "level": "tier-2",
    "country": "NG"
  }
}
````

**Success Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "b015d05c-1d9c-44f6-804f-d4a413577f25",
    "userId": "user-9876",
    "eventType": "KYC_COMPLETED",
    "data": { ... },
    "createdAt": "2025-10-30T04:47:30.177Z",
    "hederaTransactionId": "0.0.7105307@1761799643.184147274"
}
```

### 2\. Verify a Log's Integrity

Checks the local database hash against the immutable hash on the Hedera ledger.

**GET** `http://localhost:3000/logs/verify/:id`

**Success Response (Untampered):**

```json
{
    "isVerified": true,
    "logId": "b015d05c-1d9c-44f6-804f-d4a413577f25",
    "databaseHash": "c367c4f...428e",
    "hederaHash": "c367c4f...428e",
    "logDetails": { ... }
}
```

**Success Response (Tampered):**

```json
{
    "isVerified": false,
    "logId": "b015d05c-1d9c-44f6-804f-d4a413577f25",
    "databaseHash": "a123b45...888f",
    "hederaHash": "c367c4f...428e",
    "logDetails": { ... }
}
```
